* ### SQL
  * Structured Query Language.
  * It is the standard language you use to interact with a **relational database**. 
  * All data are stored in as **rows** and **columns** like a html table view. 
  * It has commands like SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT, and DELETE

* ## MySQL, PostgreSQL
  * Both of these are types of **Relational database management systems**.
  * These are applications that govern the database, providing and regulating access to the data. 
  * Both MySQL and PostgreSQL are free, open source systems, use **SQL**. 
  * There are other popular types of relational DBMSs, including **Oracle** and **SQL Server**.
  * You can use the API exposed by the database to query the data. 
  * Here there is no concept of rows and columns.


* ### NoSQL
  * NoSQL is a very broad term, but it generally refers to **Non-Relational Database Management Systems**.
  * These systems usually have query languages of their own, but they may also support SQL queries. 
  * NoSQL - All data are stored in a collection as **json format**.
  * The most popular NoSQL database is **MongoDB**.

  * **Statement**: controls transactions, program flow, connections, sessions or diagnostics
  * **Clauses**: components of queries and statment
  * **Expressions**: combination of symbols and operators and a key part of the SQL statments
  * **Predicates**: specific conditons

* #### Transaction: 
  * a transaction contains a number of sql statments. 
  * After a transacton begins, all the SQL statements are executed and at the end of the transaction, permanent changes are made in the associated tables.

* #### Procedures:
  * using a stored procedure, a method is created which contains source code for performing repetitive tasks.
